        <h2 class="title-1">Disabilities in the United States</h2>
        <p role="region" aria-labelledby="Summary">
          The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13%
          of all Americans have a non-institutionalized disability. Of the
          roughly 38,903,887 adults with a disability in the United States,
          19.7% of them live below the poverty line. This is almost double the
          number of adults in the United States who are below the poverty line.
          This is partially due to lower rates of employment for disabled
          people. In the United States, 25.9% of disabled people over the age of
          16 are employed in the civilian sector, while 59.6% of all US citizens
          over 16 are employed in the same sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing the breakdown of disability between my current state of
          residence, Utah, and the United States, Utah has a disabled population
          of 342,378 or 10.3% of the total population, compared to the United
          States which has 42,485,034 disabled people or 13.0% of the total
          population.

          the disparities between genders (male, female) and types of
          disabilities. The 7 rows represent six disability types: cognitive,
          hearing, mobility, vision, self-care, and independent living, as well
          as the percentage of individuals reporting no disability. The columns
          show the corresponding population percentages by gender.
        </p>
        <p class="strong">Key highlights:</p>
        <ul class="style-1">
          <li>
            Cognitive disabilities are more common among females than males in
            both Utah and the U.S.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hearing disabilities are more prevalent in males across both
            regions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mobility and vision disabilities tend to be higher nationally than
            in Utah.
          </li>
          <li>
            Independent living disabilities show a higher rate among females
            nationally.
          </li>
          <li>
            The majority of people in both Utah and the U.S. report no
            disability, with slightly higher rates in Utah.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are a few reasons why these disparities exist; however, that is
          not a topic for this page.

        <!-- <p>
          <span class="strong">Table 2 - Summary:</span> <br />This table
          presents the percentages of different types of disabilities by race
          (white, black, Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, and other)
          and location (Utah, United States).
        </p> -->

        <p>
          When it comes to representation by race, there are some interesting
          differences between Utah and the United States. Table 2: Disability
          Percent by Race, you can see that Utah has a higher occurrence of
          disabilities in the Black or African American, American Indian and
          Alaska Natives, Native Hawai’ian and Other Pacific Islanders, and the
          Hispanic or Latino communities than the United States as a whole.
          However, for the White community in Utah, they have a lower occurrence
          of disability than the national rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we take into consideration the rates of disabilities in the
          United States (roughly 40 million people) and Utah (roughly 350,000
          people), we can understand the importance of building accessible
          experiences for all people.

        <p>
          Even the creator of the web, Tim Berners-Lee understood the importance
          of inclusion in web design:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone
          regardless is an essential aspect.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This website applies the principles of Universal Design, as defined by
          Ronald Mace and his team:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Equitable Use</strong><br />The design is useful and
            marketable to people with diverse abilities
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexibility in Use</strong><br />The design accommodates a
            wide range of individual preferences and abilities
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple and Intuitive Use</strong><br />Use of the design is
            easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge,
            language skills, or current concentration level
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perceptible Information</strong><br />The design
            communicates necessary information effectively to the user,
            regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tolerance for Error</strong><br />The design minimizes
            hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended
            actions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Low Physical Effort</strong><br />The design can be used
            efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use</strong
            ><br />Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach,
            manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or
            mobility
