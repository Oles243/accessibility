      <p>
        <strong>Plain language</strong> is a style of writing that prioritizes
        clarity and simplicity, making information easy to understand for a
        broad audience. It involves using straightforward vocabulary, concise
        sentences, and a logical structure to ensure that the intended message
        is communicated effectively without unnecessary complexity.

        <h2 class="title-2">Why does plain language matter?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility</strong>: Plain language makes information
            accessible to everyone, including those with varying levels of
            literacy, non-native speakers, and individuals with cognitive
            disabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficiency</strong>: Clear communication reduces
            misunderstandings and the need for follow-up questions, saving time
            for both the writer and the reader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engagement</strong>: When information is easy to understand,
            readers are more likely to stay engaged and retain the information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trust</strong>: Transparent and straightforward
            communication builds trust between the writer and the audience,
            whether in business, government, or everyday interactions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By adopting plain language principles, writers can ensure their
          messages are inclusive, effective, and impactful.

      <h2 class="title-2">Plain Language Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The plain language guidelines aim to make written communication more
        accessible and understandable. They emphasize knowing your audience and
        tailoring content to their needs. Key strategies include organizing text
        to highlight main points first, using headings and lists to break up
        dense information, and avoiding technical jargon and complex sentences.
        Active voice is preferred for clarity, and consistency in style and
        terminology is crucial. While these guidelines are essential for clear
        communication, occasional deviations may occur as writers address the
        complexities of language.

        <h3><b>Original paragraph</b></h3>
        <p>
          The environmental impacts of urbanization have been significant,
          particularly concerning the increase in air pollution levels and the
          reduction in green spaces due to the expansion of infrastructure.
          Cities have been experiencing a rise in air pollutants resulting from
          increased vehicular emissions and industrial activities. This has been
          exacerbated by the reduction in natural environments, which has
          decreased the capacity for city landscapes to filter out pollution
          naturally. Noise pollution has also become predominant, with the
          increasing population density leading to a surge in transportation
          noise and general urban activity. These environmental challenges have
          prompted cities to adopt various measures aimed at mitigating their
          impacts, such as the implementation of green roofs and the creation of
          urban parks. Moreover, public transportation systems have been
          expanded and improved to reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Efforts
          to promote sustainable practices are continuing, as are initiatives to
          enhance urban resilience in the face of environmental challenges.
